## What next

### Next features?
    - List API call parameters
        - List parameters are hard coded and there is only one parameter included.
        - Lipas Api contains pretty nice ways to fetch certain types of sport places so that could be nice feature to add
    - Refresh
        - User has no way to load more or refresh list shown on main screen.

### Improvements

    - Tests doesn't fully cover app/code. They basicly templates for testing and can be continued from there
    - Error handling
        - Errors show hard coded strings which doesn't depend anything on error code enums.
    - UI
        - As can be seen, I haven't put that much effort on UI.
